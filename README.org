* Build instructions

Build is done with the =GNU Make= program. C and C++ compilers are *required* (currently tested only with =GCC=). =cd= into repository and run =make=. This will produce directory =bin= with binaries in it.
To build successfully following libraries are *required*:
- =SDL2=
- =freetype=
Currently we use =pkg-config= to detect these libraries. When running *Vulkan* driver should be installed.

*NOTE*: as engine is in active development it's build process is only tested on my Arch Linux machine.
