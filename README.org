* Features

 * rendering with Vulkan API;
 * custom voxel rendering algorithm;
 * all memory used by CPU side is preallocated at startup(1 malloc for entire engine);
 * CVar system;
 * hot loadable shaders, voxel models, configuration variables;
 * builtin console(press "~");

* Build instructions

Build is done with the =GNU Make= program. C and C++ compilers are *required* (currently tested only with =GCC=). =cd= into repository and run =make=. This will produce directory =bin= with binaries in it.
To build successfully following libraries are *required*:
- =SDL2=
- =freetype=
Currently we use =pkg-config= to detect these libraries. When running *Vulkan* driver should be installed.

*NOTE*: as engine is in active development it's build process is only tested on my Arch Linux machine.
