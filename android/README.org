* Steps to build

1. Build is done with =Android SDK= and =Android NDK=. Install them.

2. Download SDL2 library source and copy(or symlink) it to =android/app/jni/=.

3. Do the same with FreeType2 library.

4. Symlink =data/= to =android/app/src/main/assets/=.

5. Make sure shaders are compiled running =make= at project root.

6. You're done! Now you can =cd android= and build with following command:
   #+begin_src sh
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
   #+end_src

* Additional information

** Logcat

- see logs from the application:
  #+begin_src sh
    adb logcat -s SDL:* lida:*
  #+end_src
- clear output from previous runs:
  #+begin_src sh
    adb logcat -c
  #+end_src

** Frequent problems

- can't run =./gradlew installDebug=
  Enable developer mode.
